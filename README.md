Hey there! I'm Luchi, and this is my journey to becoming a front-end expert.

## Who Am I?

I'm a African-based developer with a passion for crafting beautiful and intuitive user interfaces. After dabbling in different areas of web development, I've set my sights on mastering the front-end.

## What's This About?

This GitHub repo is my digital diary, a place where I spill the beans on my wins, losses, and everything in between as I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of front-end development.

## Milestones

Hello, HTML, CSS, JS: Started with the basics. Created my first "Hello World" webpage and got hooked.

Frameworks Galore: Explored React, Vue, and Angular. Found a sweet spot with React - it just clicked!

Responsive Awesomeness: Conquered the challenges of making websites look good on all devices. Media queries, flexbox, and grid are my new best friends.

It's Okay to Break Things: The more bugs I squashed, the more I learned. Embraced the process, not just the result.

StackOverflow is Bae: No shame in seeking help. Someone out there has faced the same issue, and chances are, they've posted about it on StackOverflow.

Imposter Syndrome is Real: Constantly reminded myself that it's okay not to know everything. Growth happens outside the comfort zone.
